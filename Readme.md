# Fumi Fight
## How to Build 
- This is a unity build therefore, it only runs a single translation unit. 
- The required libraries are glad and glfw. 
- The build file builds glad by itself but requires a compiled version for glfw. 
- The libraries should be put inside vendor directory(make it right beside src directory). 
- Just hit run after that. It should compile glad and then continue on to the game.
